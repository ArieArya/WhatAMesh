This project aims to create an off-grid radio communications device that allows for local communication via a mobile app in remote regions of the world without internet connection. This is a much cheaper alternative to large and expensive telecommunication towers in rural regions, and can also be used in emergency situations through the device's SOS feature, informing all users in the network of the distress call.

It functions through the use of long-range radio (LoRa) modules connected in a meshed-network architecture, and an Arduino to connect the client application with the radio network. The network protocols is in the form of a token-ring netowrk protocol, allowing for a scalable, reliable, and fast communication system.
